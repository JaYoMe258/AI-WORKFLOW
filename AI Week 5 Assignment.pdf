Workflow Diagram (description)

🧠 1. Problem Definition
Problem: Predicting student dropout rates.
Objectives:

Identify at-risk students early.

Reduce institutional dropout rates.

Allocate intervention resources efficiently.
Stakeholders:

School administrators

Academic advisors
Key KPI: Dropout prediction accuracy

📊 2. Data Collection & Preprocessing
Data Sources:

Student behavior logs (attendance, submissions)

Demographic databases (age, location, background)

Potential Bias:

Underrepresentation of certain socio-economic groups may lead to biased predictions.

Preprocessing Steps:

Handle missing values (imputation).

Normalize numerical features.

Encode categorical variables (one-hot encoding).

🧪 3. Model Development
Model: Random Forest (due to interpretability and low overfitting risk).
Data Split:

Training: 70%

Validation: 15%

Test: 15%

Hyperparameters Tuned:

Number of trees (n_estimators)

Tree depth (max_depth)

🚀 4. Evaluation & Deployment
Metrics:

F1 Score (balanced measure of precision and recall)

Confusion Matrix

Concept Drift:
Changes in student behavior or new course patterns over time can reduce model accuracy.
Monitoring Approach: Regular retraining and performance tracking in deployment.

Deployment Challenge:
Scalability—handling many simultaneous predictions under limited compute.

🏥 5. Case Study Application: Hospital Readmission Prediction
📌 Problem Scope:
Predict patient readmission within 30 days.

Stakeholders: doctors, discharge teams.

📦 Data Strategy:
Sources: Electronic Health Records (EHR), demographics, medical history.

Ethical Concerns:

Data privacy (HIPAA compliance)

Potential discrimination (bias against underrepresented groups)

Preprocessing:

Feature engineering: age groups, diagnosis encoding, vital stats.

Missing value handling and normalization.

🔍 Model Development:
Random Forest Classifier

Confusion Matrix:

True Positives: 70

False Positives: 10

Precision: 87.5%

Recall: 77.8%

🧩 Deployment:
Integration: Deploy as a REST API inside hospital infrastructure.

Compliance: Use anonymization, secure encryption, and data access logs.

Optimization Technique: Dropout + cross-validation to prevent overfitting.

🧠 6. Critical Thinking
Bias in Training Data:

If mostly trained on urban or affluent populations, the model may fail for rural/low-income patients.

Mitigation:

Use diverse and balanced training data from various demographic groups.

Apply fairness-aware learning techniques (e.g., reweighing sensitive attributes).

⚖️ Trade-offs:
Interpretability vs Accuracy:

In healthcare, simpler models (e.g., decision trees) may be preferred for transparency, even if slightly less accurate.

Limited Resources Impact:

Lightweight models (e.g., logistic regression) might be preferred over deep neural networks in constrained environments.

✍️ 7. Reflection
Challenging Part:
Designing a model pipeline that considers ethics and real-world deployment issues.

What I'd Improve:
Spend more time tuning models and integrating monitoring tools to detect drift post-deployment.
